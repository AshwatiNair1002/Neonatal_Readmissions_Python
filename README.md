This was an individual project for the HI 2454 course for the MHSI program at UPitt.
Using Python, data analysis was perfomed to determine factors that increased the risk of hospital readmissions in neonates.
Data was sourced from two datasets-  “Pediatric All-Payer Readmissions in Massachusetts” and the  the “Screening Disorders by Race/Ethnicity” table from the California Department of Public Health’s Newborn Screening Disorders dataset.
Techiniques used for analysis include linear and logistic regression. Naive Bayes and Decision Tree models were built as well.
